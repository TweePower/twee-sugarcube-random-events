<h3>testRandomEvent7</h3>

After when some event with `limitationStrategy[...].tags` = `["Daily"]` or `["Street", "Daily"]` will be fired, it will prevent this event running
Here I set group not as a string, but as a array, where:
`group.name` is group name
`group.weight` is wight which used to find winner, default weight = 10
In this exapmle weight=20, also we have 4 events with default weight=10
Total = 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60
When weight=20, win percent chance = (100/60)*20 ~= 33.3
When weight=10, win percent chance = (100/60)*10 ~= 16.6
